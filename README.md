This repository contains the code used for our study comparing end-to-end deep learning (DL) and feature-based machine learning (ML) approaches for genomic biomarker prediction from tumour sequencing data across exome-wide and targeted-panel settings. It extends the ATGC multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for somatic small variants and adds multimodal modelling with gene-level copy-number features, calibration utilities, and interpretation workflows used to generate manuscript figures and tables.

The MIL implementation is based on the ATGC codebase (https://github.com/BarasLab/ATGC) and has been adapted for MSI and HRD prediction, evaluation across pseudo-panels and real panel cohorts, and direct comparison to ML baselines. The CNV encoder component was inspired by recent sequence-modeling work on RNA profiles (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.18.599483v4
).
